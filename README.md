# Excel Budget Planner

Hi All ðŸ‘‹, as a personal finance enthusiast it was only right that I shared my budget planner with you ðŸ¤‘. 
You can input and track your spending on the go (via excel app) and allocate your budget for the month. You can view a summary of your savings and plan ahead. A cool feature I added was the summarise table for the month of december which allows you to view how the last 12 months have gone for you financially. Feel free to use and edit the file as you see fit ðŸ¤—
